# Disney+ Brazil (Landing Page Clone)
This project is part of the Front-End course I am taking at EBAC. The main goal is to reproduce the Disney+ Brazil landing page using modern front-end development tools.


## Description:
The project was developed to visually recreate the homepage of Disney+ Brazil. It is important to note that the icons and buttons do not link to external pages, as the focus of this work is on cloning the appearance of the landing page.

## Tools:
During the development, the following tools and technologies were used:

- Gulp: for task automation such as style compilation, image, and script minification.
- Sass: to facilitate styling with additional features like variables, mixins, and CSS nesting.
- JavaScript: for adding interactivity to the page, including:
  - Header Section: Hiding and revealing the header based on user interaction.
  - Attractions Section: Programming tabs to display different content dynamically.
  - FAQ Section: Implementing an accordion to expand and collapse questions and answers.

## Gulp Task Overview

- Styles: Compiles .scss files into CSS and compresses them.
- Images: Optimizes and minifies images for better loading performance.
- Scripts: Minifies JavaScript files.
- Watch: Monitors changes in .scss and .js files and automatically executes the relevant tasks.

## SCSS and Methodology
The project involved working with multiple SCSS files, adhering to the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to maintain a clean and modular structure in the stylesheets.

## Considerations
This project was developed exclusively for educational purposes, focused on learning and practicing front-end development tools and concepts. It has no official connection with Disney+ or The Walt Disney Company.
